If benchmarking is discovering out how long a piece of code takes to run as a
whole, then profiling means figuring out how much time each function, method, or
instruction spends. What do programmers use profilers for? The primary purpose,
of course, is to optimize their code. But you don't want to go tweaking and
rewriting your code blindly, spending time on optimizations that might not even
matter. Profiling gives you exactly that. It identifies who are *the primary
contributors* to your program's execution time. Once you know them, you can
focus on revising them first as it will have the biggest effect.

Many decent JVM profilers exist, but in this post, we will use the one called
VisualVM. It is not the most accurate or feature-rich profiler out there, but it
is free and actively developed. Actually, it is already included in your JDK
distribution, so you can immediately launch it as `jvisualvm` in your
terminal[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1)<a name="bfn1"></a>. However, I recommend you grab
the version from [the official website](https://visualvm.github.io) since its
release schedule is not tied to Java and it's more up-to-date there. If you
install it from the site, you'll have to launch it differently (e.g., it is
called "VisualVM" in Launchpad on MacOS).

Go ahead and start it now.

### VisualVM interface

The interface of this tool is quite uncomplicated. On the left, you will see the
Applications toolbar showing the local and remote Java processes that you can
connect to. Since profiling Clojure is not much different from profiling Java
apps, and VisualVM doesn't even know you are running a Clojure program, you just
conn... wait, what?

I'm running a single `lein repl` session, why do I see two Clojure processes? In
case you didn't know, Leiningen launches two processes per each session, one for
itself and one for application in use. There is a neat trick to figure out which
is which, with the JDK tool called `jcmd`[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1):

<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/posts/visualvm-jcmd.png">
<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">jcmd</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

In this example, process 99841 is Leiningen's bootstrap JVM, and process 99847
is our actual REPL. They usually go in order, so you only have to remember to
connect to the later one, but it is nice being able to double-check.

*Note: Boot users don't have such problems, one Boot process = one JVM.*

Let's connect to the second Clojure process by double-clicking on it in the
Applications frame. VisualVM will hang for a few seconds and then will open its
main window on the right. You will see multiple clickable tabs, **Overview**
being the active one. Here VisualVM lists different parameters of the current
JVM process. **Monitor** tab is like a dashboard for the process, showing CPU
activity, memory usage dynamics, and some other things. **Threads** tab can
sometimes be incredibly useful for understanding performance, but we won't focus
on it today. We are here for profiling. Can you guess which tab you should click
then?

Go home, Captain Obvious, it's not your day. We need the **Sampler** tab. To
explain why it is so we'll have to take a little diversion and explore which
types of profiles are there.

- **Sampler** in VisualVM represents
  a
  [statistical profiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_\(computer_programming\)#Statistical_profilers).
  The way it works is it regularly takes a stack snapshot for each live thread
  and notes which methods were on the stack at that moment. Then, it uses this
  information to infer approximately how long each method has been running. The
  reasoning is the following: if 9 of 10 stack samples contain method `foo()`,
  and only 1 sample contains `bar()`, then `foo` must run 9 times longer than
  `bar`. <br class="inlist"> Because it is based on statistics, a sampling
  profiler doesn't really know how many invocations of each method happened, or
  how much time exactly each method spent. But, surprisingly, statistical
  profilers are quite accurate if you give them a good sampling rate (around
  10-100 Hz) and some time to run.
- **Profiler** corresponds to
  an
  [instrumenting profiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_\(computer_programming\)#Instrumentation).
  Instrumentation means that the profiler is going to recompile each and every
  method in the JVM to inject its profiling code inside. The profiling code will
  track every entrance and exit in/out of the method, and the time spent inside.
  Now, this way of profiling makes no guesses, it knows for certain what methods
  were the slowest and most called. The problem is in "recompile every method"
  part. Because of the way Clojure compiler is implemented, a bare Clojure
  application contains thousands of classes, let alone methods. Setting an
  instrumenting profiler on a Clojure program will **grind your program to a
  halt**. It will take 5-10 minutes for the profiler to finish instrumenting,
  and good luck using your program after that. <br class="inlist"> To be fair,
  some of the other profilers, like YourKit, have a better working
  instrumentation. But even if an instrumenting profiler doesn't render your
  program completely unusable, there is another problem with this kind of
  profilers. Because instrumentation is by definition invasive (methods are
  recompiled to contain code that you didn't write), the veracity of its results
  greatly diminishes. Furthermore, depending on the implementation, an
  instrumenting profiler can disable JIT and inlining for your code for better
  introspection. Suddenly, the instrumented code that you profile stops
  resembling the original code entirely. It is ironic that an instrumenting
  profiler claims to be *more precise* and ends up falsifying the results to a
  greater extent.

So, "Sampler" that is.

### Sampler

Before we begin the profiling, we need to give ourselves something to run. The
following two functions will do.

```clojure
(defn burn-cpu [op secs]
  (let [start (System/nanoTime)]
    (while (< (/ (- (System/nanoTime) start) 1e9) secs)
      (op))))

(defn test-one []
  (burn-cpu #(reduce + (map inc (range 1000))) 10))
```

The first function runs a nullary function `op` in a loop for the specified
number of seconds. The second function is but a faÃ§ade to the first.

Switch to the "Sampler" tab and press the **CPU** button. You will immediately
see methods that sit around and do nothing. Now, execute `(test-one)` in your
REPL. In 10 seconds you will see something like this:

</figure>
</center>

In an effort to make sense out of all this, let's start from deciphering what
the columns mean.

- **Self Time** is the time that the method spent executing its body **without**
  the time spent in the methods it called. In statistical profilers, it
  corresponds to the number of samples where the method was **on the top of the
  stack**.
- **Total Time** is the time the method spent **including** the time waiting for
  results from other methods. In statistical profilers, it corresponds to the
  number of samples where the method was **anywhere on the stack**.

Take, for example, the method `user$burn_cpu.invokeStatic()` (which corresponds
to our function `burn-cpu`). Its total time is 10,002 milliseconds because
during the whole sampler run we never returned from this function (only in the
end). But its Self Time is small because `burn-cpu` itself didn't really do much
besides spinning the loop and calling into the provided `op`.

The respective (CPU) columns show the chunk of time that the method was really
doing work on the CPU, not just waited for some event. In our simple test, the
CPU times are identical to corresponding total times because we don't do any
I/O, or locking, or `Thread.sleep`. For real code, those numbers will differ.

So, what does all this actually tell us? We can see that the bulk of time
spending happens in different methods of `clojure.lang.Numbers` class, so, short
of using unsafe math, you can't really accelerate those. Laziness also eats away
a considerable number of cycles (manifested by `clojure.core$seq` and methods
that have "chunk" in their names); we can speed that up by turning the code
eager. We won't be doing any of this today, but just looking at this simple
example through a profiler already gives us some insights and ideas.

Oh, and the best part. Since we are using Clojure, we can redefine any function
in the REPL, and the sampler will pick up the changes immediately. We don't even
have to reconnect to the process! This is so much more convenient than the
typical Java workflow, and we are getting it with a tool that was originally
designed for Java. That's the power of Clojure!

###### Intermission: what is clojure.core$map$fn__4785.invoke()?

If you've never seen before how classes compiled by Clojure look like, you might
be confused by these weird names. First of all, `$` in a class name represents
the inner class. So, `map` is an inner class in `clojure.core` and `fn__4785` is
an inner class of `map`. And `fn__XXXX` is how the Clojure compiler internally
names the anonymous function. So, together, the method name in the title
corresponds to an invocation of some lambda defined inside the
`clojure.core/map` function.

When you sort the profiling results by "Total time" column, you will find the
method `user$test_one$fn__19922` (the number will be different). This is our
lambda `#(reduce + ...)`, defined in `test-one`! It has the Total Time of 10
seconds and the Self Time of 0 seconds because all it does is calling into
`reduce` and passing the result up.

In case you have multiple anonymous functions defined in a single named
function, and you're having a hard time recognizing which is which in your
profiling results, you can give them names by using `(fn mylambda [...] ...)`
syntax. Then, Clojure will generate a class name like
`myns$myfunction$mylambda`. But *naming anonymous functions* kinda defeats the
purpose, doesn't it?

###### End of intermission

There is even more profiling data hiding behind the **Snapshot** button (just
above the methods table, on the left). Click it. A new tab will open, with tabs
below. The current one, **Call tree**, starts with the list of threads that were
alive at the moment of profiling. Click on the arrow next to `nREPL-worker-X`
thread (thread where your REPL expression was executed).

<center>
<figure class="figure">
<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/posts/visualvm-call-tree.png">
<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The call tree unfurled.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

This view shows what the execution time of each method consists of. Generally,
it is made up of calls to other methods, and some percentage of "Self time." All
those methods that expanded automatically only call into the child method and
have next to none self-time â they are of zero interest to us. The first
function that has something going on inside is
`clojure.core.protocols$fn__6750`, because it calls both `chunk-next` and
`ArrayChunk.reduce`. From there, you can expand the stack frames further to see
what makes up the profile.

The next tab, **Hot Spots** is almost the same as the initial Sampler view, with
the exception that you can filter the methods by a particular thread. Otherwise,
not much else to say about it.

The **Combined** tab is very helpful. This view combines two previous tabs so
you can select a hot method in the bottom frame, the upper frame will highlight
this method in the call stack. When the same method is called from multiple
spots, you are able to navigate between the call sites with the arrow buttons on
the top.

### Conclusion

Oh my, so many words written, and we haven't even touched upon the memory
profiling! Indeed, profiling is a long and tough topic; the abundance of
features and views in the profilers didn't appear on a whim â it spawned from a
necessity to look at your application performance profile from different angles
before making an educated guess. After all, even with all these tools,
optimizing the performance is still a kind of magic â it requires plenty of
experience and some good intuition.

Now that you know how to use a profiler, what you should look for when profiling
your own programs? A common approach is to search for "plateaus" â methods with
high total time percentage and simultaneously big self-time. Such methods have
expensive bodies optimizing which will give the most significant performance
boost. Another potential for improvement comes from "odd" methods that spend
more time than they should due to a bug or unmet assumption. Each such method
may not weigh much on its own, but optimizing a few of those may improve the
performance as much as rewriting a single wide plateau.

This post comes to its end. It surely couldn't teach you all the tricks and
practices to profiling, but hopefully, it gave you the basis to start exploring
on your own. In future posts, we will cover some frequent patterns that slow
down your Clojure application. Until then, stay tuned!
