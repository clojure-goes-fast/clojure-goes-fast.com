## Consulting

At Clojure Goes Fast, we offer consultancy services to help you optimize the
performance and efficiency of your Clojure and Java applications. While our
mission is to make the performance knowledge, instruments, and best practices
publicly available and free, we understand that many performance challenges
require a personalized approach and in-depth analysis.

If you are seeking to enhance the performance characteristics of your Clojure
software, we provide the following:

- Comprehensive measurement and analysis of your application's performance,
  identification of bottlenecks, and recommendations or implementation of
  improvements.
- Expert guidance on architecting small to large-scale systems with a focus on
  achieving desired performance and latency targets.
- Tailored support for Clojure Goes Fast open-source tools, including custom
  feature development and extended support for older Clojure versions.
- Specialized training to effectively leverage performance tools and libraries
  within the context of your particular domain.

We invite you to reach out to us at
[hello@clojure-goes-fast.com](mailto:hello@clojure-goes-fast.com), and we'll
work together to find the right solution for your needs.
