# clojure-goes-fast.com

This repository contains sources from
which [clojure-goes-fast.com](https://clojure-goes-fast.com/) website is created.
It is a static site generated by [Cryogen](https://cryogenweb.org/).

## Build

You need [tools.deps](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure) to be installed. Then:

    clojure -X:watch

will build the site into `public/` directory and automatically regenerate it if
any content changes. You can then start e.g. `python3 -m http.server 3000` in
that directory to view it in the browser.

To build the final version of the site do:

    clojure -X:build
